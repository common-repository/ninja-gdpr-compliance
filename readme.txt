**WordPress GDPR CCPA DPA Cookie Compliance**

[DOCUMENTATION](https://ninjateam.gitbook.io/gdpr-compliance/how-it-works/cookie-popup/cookie-popup) | [ADMIN DEMO](https://gdpr.ninjateam.org/)

GDPR requires businesses to protect personal user data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. And non-compliance could cost companies up to $20 million or 4% of global revenue.

Websites that collect data on citizens in European Union (EU) countries must comply with strict new rules around protecting customer data by May 25, 2018. Being GDPR Compliant or your business will be at risk.
 
That’s why GDPR Visual Builder—Drag and Drop to enable GDPR CCPA Compliance was created: to give your website the best solution for complying with this new law.
 
== Why you need GDPR Compliance? ==

- If you run a WordPress website that EU visitors can access, your site needs to be GDPR compliant.
- If you take advantage of using cookies, or other tracking integrations like Facebook pixels or Google Analytics, etc.
- If you use a form plugin like [Contact Form 7 Database](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-database/) to collect user data, you need GDPR compliance.
- If you use MailChimp or other [email marketing plugins](https://ninjateam.org/best-email-marketing-wordpress-plugins/) to save users’ data, you need this GDPR compliance support.
- If you use any communication service like live chat or support help desk for your site visitors, you need this custom-made EULA and keep your business safe.
- If your want your business to be secured and trusted and you just need to focus on working and being prospered.
- 
Apart from being compliant with GDPR, website owners outside EU would also be advised to get ready before law enforcement of the upcoming California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), Washington Privacy Act (WPA), the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI - Japan) and other regulations to be passed. Hence Ninja GDPR plugin then comes in handy. Get prepared now!
